                The privacy of our customers is of utmost importance to us. This Privacy Policy sets out how we manage personal information across our business. It applies to A3R Car Rental and to the practices of the agents and contractors engaged by us to provide goods and services. It also applies to your use of our website and your dealings with us as a customer.

                We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The most current version will always be located on our website and is also available by contacting our Privacy Officer on +6010 562 1195 or at the address detailed below.

                Types of personal information we collect and hold

                The types of personal information we collect and hold will vary depending on your dealings with us such as products, services and benefits we (or our agents, contractors and third parties) provide to you, or a request or inquiry you make in relation to such products, benefits and services.

                This information may include any or all of the following:

                Full Name, Mobile No., Email Address, Date of Birth, Gender
                Vehicle details including registration no., model and color
                Driver's license number and/or passport number and, upon our request, a copy of your driver's license or passport;
                Transaction details relating to your use of our products, services or other benefits;
                Your social media preferences; and any preferences you tell us about or any other information that you provide.
                We may collect and hold sensitive information, such as the fact that you are disabled, to allow us to provide our services more effectively to you but only if you provide express consent at the time it is provided.

                Website cookies and digital services

                We collect and hold such information for statistical and maintenance purposes that enables us to continually evaluate our website performance. Some parts of our websites also use "cookies". A "cookie" is a small text file that is placed on your computer's hard drive by a web page server. Cookies store information about the use of our website and are used to identify new or previous visitors to the website and what pages have been accessed. Most web browsers are set to accept cookies, but this function can usually be disabled if you wish. Please note that if you do disable this, not all functionality on our websites will be available to you.

                We also use Google Analytics features (including Google Remarketing, Google Display Network Impressions Reporting, the Double Click Campaign Manager and Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting) on our website, which uses both first party and third party cookies to record standard Internet traffic information.  We, and some third parties (including Google), also use the information to optimize ad selection for groups of individuals based on age, gender, interests and past visits to our site.  The cookies allow us and other third parties (including Google) to evaluate your interactions with ad services on our site and serve targeted advertising on sites across the Internet.  We have enabled Google Analytics for Display Advertising which allows Google and other third parties to advertise to you on our site and across the Internet.

                We also use (along with third parties including Google) first party cookies (such as Google Analytic cookies) and third party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) to report how our ad impressions, other uses of ad services, and interactions with these ad impressions and ad services are related to visits to our website.  In addition, we may use data from Google's Interest-based advertising or third party audience data (such as age, gender, and interests) with Google Analytics to help us understand how user activity varies based on these factors.

                By using Google Ads Settings (www.google.com/settings/ads), you can opt out of these features at any time and customize your Google Display Network Ads.  Alternatively, you can opt out of a third party's vendor's use of cookies by visiting the Network Advertising Initiative opt-out page (see http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/#completed).

                Importantly, we do not combine the anonymous information collected through Google Analytics with personally identifiable information.

                In addition to Google Analytics, we use a range of web analytics tools (such as web beacons) to help us understand consumer behaviour and use of our website.  In particular, these tools enable us to deliver cookies, count visits and understand usage and campaign effectiveness.  This data helps us to stay connected and relevant to our customers.

                If you do not wish to receive any cookies you may set your browser to refuse cookies.  However, this will mean that we will not be able to personalize your website each time you visit.

                Why we collect and hold personal information

                Generally, we collect, hold and use personal information about our customers to provide them with a range of products, services and benefits. This includes, collecting and using your personal information to complete your rental booking; to provide you services in connection with your rental.

                We also collect personal information to assist in identifying ways in which we can serve you better, such as providing our products and services to you more effectively.

                Some of the information we collect is for the purpose of improving our interaction with customers, suppliers, business partners and contractors and their involvement with A3R. We collect personal information about third parties, including family members, for purposes in relation to your and their dealings (either directly or indirectly) with A3R.

                Customers who provide personal information about a third party individual need to ensure that those persons are aware of this Privacy Policy, understand it and agree to accept it. If that individual does not have the capacity to understand and agree to these terms, A3R requires a parent or guardian to give the assurances set out in this paragraph.

                How we collect information

                Generally, we collect personal information directly from you, such as when you make a reservation or request a product or service, in the course of providing you with that product or service, or when you have other dealings with us. For example, we may collect your personal information from our rental locations or through our in-vehicle technology.

                We may collect and update that information over the phone, over the Internet, in person, when you write to us or if you participate in our marketing campaigns. We may also collect personal information through third parties such as:

                Storage and protection of personal information

                We store personal information in a combination of secure computer storage facilities and paper-based files and other records. In so doing, we have taken numerous steps to protect your personal information from misuse, interference and loss, and unauthorized access, modification or disclosure.

                Additionally we take reasonable steps to destroy or permanently de-identify personal information when we no longer need it. We impose strict requirements of security and confidentiality on all third parties as to how they store, handle and deal with your personal information.

                Direct Marketing

                We collect personal information so that we can provide our customers with useful and relevant information about our products and services. Generally, we collect this information directly from you.  In some circumstances, however, we may collect personal information from third parties, including from our service providers and social media platforms such as Facebook.  We use the information we, or our service providers, collect to assist us to determine how we can best engage with our customers about our products and services.  To this end, we, or our service providers, may collect information about your social media preferences and activities so that we can engage with our customers on social media sites.  We may also collect certain demographic information and behavioural information from social media platforms to better serve consumers with more targeted advertising.  If we do not collect this information in the ways described above, we may not be able to let you know about our products and services in the most effective way.

                We may use and disclose the information we collect for the purpose of providing you with tailored marketing communications about our goods and services, or to conduct market research. Typically, we send these communications to your email address or mailing address.  Occasionally, we may also send marketing communications to your social media accounts, including, for example, your Facebook account.

                We may also disclose your personal information to companies in the A3R, to our other business partners, and its related entities, to give you information and offers about products and services offered by us or these companies.
